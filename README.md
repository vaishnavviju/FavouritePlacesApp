# PlacesApp
This is a Favorite Places app made using flutter. It can be used to add your favourite places along with their picture and location. The picture is obtained by using native features to access the camera while the location package is used to obtain and store the user's latitude and longitude. The user can then view and add more places.
The data is added and accessed using providers and notifiers. 
We do a local (on-device) storage and sql storage in this project.
